### Project Name - AMBULANCE ALERT SYSTEM

### Overview
This project is about reducing  ambulance commute time , by making an ambulance alert system.
In this we implemented google api's to calculate position of ambulance when emergency system is on and accordingly we notify vehicles
around it with gps to alert them beforehand, so they can adjust and giv a save passage to the ambulance in the side provided by the
the notification, this will create a passage on one side of the road without any confusion or noise.This will directly reduce the
commute time of patient. We also implemented a reassurance system i.e smart contract ,by which we recheck and verify if the
ambulance which is not on duty don't use this system and cause problems to public. 

### Technology Used
NodeJs           - Server,client and ambulance interface.

Smart Contract   - To reassure and verify ambulance is on duty or not.


### Steps for setting up application-

Install all the dependencies using `npm install`
npm run start
open index.html file in smart contract to access smart
